# Plan of Attack for Analysis:
- retrieve list of HOF pitchers
- get season data for each pitcher

- run analysis on certain features for each pitcher
  to be fair we'll probably just focus solely on starting pitchers
    - group by decades?
    - see what decades/baseball era had more HOF 
    - find similiarities for pitchers:
       - WAR
       - SO
       - Innings pitched
       - ERA
       - Opponent Batting Averages
       - Complete Games
       - other things?
       
- Then incorporate Dennis Martinez into the mix and run stat comparison
    among HOF pitchers
    
    
* ultimately we can create a report that could input any pitcher and compare
among the HOF pitchers



### We then can move into the modeling aspect, specifically
### can we predict if a pitcher is a HOF solely on their stas
